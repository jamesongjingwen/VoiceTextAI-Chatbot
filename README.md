# VoiceText AI Chatbot

### Project Overview

This project presents an interface that integrates OpenAI's powerful API, enabling users to interact through both text and voice inputs. Using Tkinter for the GUI, it offers a user-friendly platform where users can conveniently prompt the system either by typing or speaking. In return, the interface provides intelligent responses in both formats, leveraging the robust capabilities of machine learning and natural language processing.

### Key Features:

    - Dual Input Modes: Supports voice and text inputs for versatile user interactions.
    - AI-Driven Responses: Utilizes OpenAI's API for accurate and context-aware answers.
    - Text-to-Speech & Speech-to-Text: Seamlessly converts voice to text and vice versa, enhancing accessibility.
    - Tkinter GUI: Simple and intuitive graphical user interface for ease of use.

### How It Works:

    - User Prompt: Initiate a query by typing in the text box or using the voice input feature.
    - AI Processing: The system, powered by OpenAI's API, processes the input and formulates a response.
    - Response Delivery: Replies are delivered in both text and voice message.
